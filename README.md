# vue-experiment

I want to practice Vue-cli + SPA + i18n.

## This repository was archived

Progress.

- [x] SPA was successfully added.
- [x] MPA was successfully added.
- [ ] vue-i18n was successfully added though, each message couldn't be set in each component.
- [x] Use different layout in each component.
- [ ] Cannot import different external css files and use them only in each component.

```html
<style scoped>
  @import '../assets/index.css';
</style>
```

Gave up this experiment and have gone to angular-experiment.
